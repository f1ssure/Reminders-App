# Reminders App (in development)

This is a simple web app that lets you save tasks as reminders that can later be marked as completed.

## Purpose 

My goals as a developer are to familiarize myself with:
  - React.js/Next.js
  - Tailwind CSS
  - TypeScript
  - Component-based UI architecture
  - Firebase, specifically Firestore
